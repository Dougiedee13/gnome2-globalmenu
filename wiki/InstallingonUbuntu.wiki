a step by step guide for Gutsy Gibbon

THIS IS A DRAFT. DO NOT USE. IT KILLS KITTENS AND COMPUTERS TOO
= Introduction =
a step by step guide which assumes that you've never compiled anything on your system, and that this system is Gutsy Gibbon.

==Installing with debs==
===on a 32 bit system===
  * Open a terminal
  * Create a folder
    {{{ mkdir global-menu-install}}} 
  * Go to this folder
    {{{ cd global-menu-install}}}
  * Get the patched gtk debs and panel applet with the following instruction
    {{{ wget http://gnome2-globalmenu.googlecode.com/files/gnome-globalmenu-0.4.2_ubuntu-gusty-svn679.tar.gz}}}
   
    
  * Unarchive them
    {{{tar zxvf gnome-globalmenu-0.4.2_ubuntu-gusty-svn679.tar.gz }}}
  
  * Install them
    # {{{cd gnome-globalmenu }}}
    # {{{sudo dpkg -i *.deb}}}

  * *NOTE* if you have installed previous version of gnome-globalmenu and meet a dependency error of {{{libgtk-directfb-2.0-0 libgtk-directfb-2.0-dev libgtk2.0-0-dbg}}}, you can just remove them, since they are not installed by default.
   {{{sudo dpkg -r libgtk-directfb-2.0-0 libgtk-directfb-2.0-dev libgtk2.0-0-dbg}}}
    
    if you still meet some errors here, try
{{{
    sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite *.deb 
}}}

   * Edit ~/.gnomerc
     # add a line to it
     {{{export GTK_MODULES=libgnomenu }}}

  * Restart your computer and right-click on the panel and click add to the panel. Look for Global Menubar. Add it. And voila. It should work.

===on a 64 bit system===
There is not yet packages for 64 bit system. We don't know how to build it from our poor 32bit boxes.
Also, the building will panic with an error. See below for details.

==Installing from source==
*Warning* 
someone has reported that building on 64 bit system is not available now. We don't have a 64 bit system to investigate the reason. So if you build successfully on 64 bit system, *PLEASE* contact us at the [http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/issues/list Issues list]

The old guide doesn't work anymore. Refer to the 
[ http://ayozone.org/2008/03/12/global-menu-the-new-gnome-macmenu/  guide ] written by Ayoli.
