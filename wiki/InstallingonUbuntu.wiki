==Installing from the GNOME Global Menu PPA (Intrepid) ==
This is the best way to get the latest version of the GlobalMenu.
 # Add the apt sources.list entries.

{{{
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome2-globalmenu/ubuntu intrepid main

deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome2-globalmenu/ubuntu intrepid main
}}}

 # Install the GlobalMenu package.

{{{
sudo apt-get remove gnome2-globalmenu
}}}

and then execute:

{{{
sudo apt-get install gnome-globalmenu 
}}}

==Installing with debs on a 32 or 64 bit system==
You can download the deb directly from the PPA page and install it manually.

There are now 64-bit Ubuntu packages in the PPA. Please test them and report any bug you may find (after checking for duplicates). For more information, see [http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/issues/detail?id=149 Issue 149]
