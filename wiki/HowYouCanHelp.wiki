   * Using your skills to help developing Gnome Global Menu;
   * Writing documentation;
   * [Translation Translating] it into your language;
   * Taking relevant tips and info from the [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=241868 UbuntuForums.org thread] and summering it;

Mini projects available to all, coders or non coders

In the spirit of GHOP which enabled this project to get a second life, here are a few mini-project that you can do without having to be a coder or a GTK+ wizard. We hope it might attract even more people around GnomeMenu and the concept of a document centric desktop, and help foster the project.
Note that unlike GHOP, the only prize you'll get is a special mention and the gratitude of many others (and a perhaps a free beer/soda if you happen to come in Paris one day ;-)
