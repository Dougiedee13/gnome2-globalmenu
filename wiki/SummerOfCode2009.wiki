Description:
	(required) 	

The GlobalMenu Project aims to bring the features of modern document-centric desktops to Linux, especially global menus in its first phase. This task is actually quite hefty, given our aim for a standards-based cross-desktop solution, including Gnome, KDE and XFCE, and possibly more, thanks to a carefully designed specification.
Our other task is to enable the most popular toolkits and applications to detach their menus and thus provide compatibility.

Why is your group applying to participate? What do you hope to gain by participating?
	(required) 	
We hope to foster the growth of the Document-centric approach as the Open Source scene is trying to catch up on MacOSX which is the only other big player in that area. We also hope to find students passionate about this approach to the Desktop, and to expand their skills to enable them to make further progress in the Free Desktop area, and possibly as a member of the GlobalMenu project. who would like already have skills in Free Software

What is the application template you would like contributors to your organization to use.


Your application must be written in English and contain a detailed description of your project proposal (even if it's a proposed idea).  We're especially interested in the following questions (but not exclusively):

    * What is its ultimate goal?
    * What components will it have?
    * What benefits does it have for GlobalMenu, its community and the upstream desktop projects?
    * Why you'd like to complete this particular project?
    * How do you plan to achieve completion of your project?
          o We' like to see a schedule with dates and important milestones/deliveries. 
    * Why do you think you are be the best person to work on this project?
    * What are your past experiences (if any) with the open source world?
    * Could you describe us your view of the ideal desktop ? Why are you interested in Document-centric ideas? 
    * Please (if possible) attach a link to a bug containing a patch you've written (in any project related to your application - be it GlboalMenu, an upstream project or any relevant open-source project.			
	
We love neat application and do not have clear guidelines for the format. BUT It will of course influence us in our selection. We indeed tend to think that both content and presentation are important (why else would we work on a document-centric desktop ?) .

What is your plan for dealing with disappearing contributors?
	(required) 	
What is your plan for dealing with disappearing members?
	(required) 	
We have members in Germany, China, France, England and Italy to chase them and hunt them down ;-)
More seriously, we'll do all that you'd expect, and more.
I'd say:
-listen for any problems, and make it clear to announce any snags proactively (even if they don't actually happen)
-provide very quick feedback
-never give up without being intrusive or annoying in a way that could further hinder the motivation.
What steps will you take to encourage contributors to interact with your community before, during, and after the program?
	(required) 	
What will you do to ensure that your accepted contributors stick with the project after the program concludes?

Please select your backup group administrator.


== About Google SOC ==
Google is sponsoring students to work during this summer on open source projects.

== About Global Menu ==

Global Menu is the globally-shared menu bar of all applications launched in your desktop session.

This project introduces document-oriented concepts into GNOME, and improves GNOME's respect for Fitts's law. Most GTK applications work just fine with Global Menu. See ApplicationCompatibility for a list of them.

= Ideas =

Ordered by the priority.

== XFCE port of Global Menu ==

=== Background ===
Although there is already an XFCE panel plugin out there, its lacks functionalities comparing with the Gnome panel applet. The either switcher is missing, and there is no way to enable/disable Global Menu without modifying magic configuration files.

=== Goals ===
The XFCE port shares the same GTK plugin module with the current Gnome port. Therefore a complete XFCE port of Global Menu should finish the panel plugin:
  * Tracking the current application (activity)'s title,
  * Switching focus between applications (NOT windows, refer to the application mode of metacity),
  * Launching new applications.
  * Enabling / Disabling the GTK Plugin module on the fly by modifying the GtkSettings on the screen.
  * Also, design a default menu when the desktop is focused, the default menu may incorporate the features listed above, or not.

The XFCE port is crucial for the Global Menu project to survive in a long run. Because as we know, the next generation of Gnome will ship with Gnome Shell, introducing a completely redesigned way of human-computer interaction. Whether Global Menu still can make sense in this new design is still an open question. Besides the design issue, there is also technical obstacles to integrate Clutter based Gnome Shell Panel and Gtk based Global Menu widget sets together.
On the other hand XFCE, targeting at low-end computers, may stick with the traditional GTK and panels for a longer period.

=== Requirements ===

  * GTK programming experience with C or Vala
  * experience with XFCE software development

== KDE Unification ==
=== Background ===
Back in KDE 3.x, a global menu was implemented; however the implementation is incompatable with current Global Menu. In KDE 4.x, that global menu implementation is removed. KDE people, have come up with a QStyle plugin for QT4, and a Plasma applet XBar, for their own global menu(referred as XBar). However, this implementation is not designed to be GUI toolkit independent. As a result, XBar is incompatible with Global Menu.

 * Global Menu Specification - http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/wiki/GlobalMenuSpecification

=== Goals ===
Modify XBar to fully implement the Global Menu specification, so that QT applications and GTK applications can share the same, unified Global Menu.

=== Requirements ===
 * QStyle knowledge
 * Knowledge in X11 program development
 * C++ experience

== Patch XUL runner, enable Global Menu with Firefox == 

=== Background ===
It has been long known that XUL runner programs doesn't use native GTK, and therefore can not benefit from the Global Menu's GTK Plugin. However most distributions nowadays ship their GNOME desktop with Firefox or Firefox variations instead of the default GNOME browser Epiphany. The result is direct: on a desktop with Global Menu enabled, the default web browser, which is accessed by the user almost everyday becomes an exception that behaves differently from all other applications. Too bad. This proposed SOC project aims to fix the issue.

References: 
 * Global Menu Specification - http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/wiki/GlobalMenuSpecification

=== Goals ===
Patch XUL runner to implement a Global Menu client inside it. 
 * Interpolate the menu into Global Menu XML
 * Bind the XML to the toplevel window
 * Receive and understands the Global Menu events

=== Requirements ===
 * Experience with XUL runner programming
 * C++ experience
 * Knowledge in X11 or GDK

== Patch OpenOffice ==
It has been long known that OpenOffice doesn't use native GTK, and therefore can not benefit from the Global Menu's GTK Plugin. However no fully usable office suite that utilizes native GTK is available. The result is direct: on a desktop with Global Menu enabled, the default office suite, which is accessed by the user almost everyday becomes an exception that behaves differently from all other applications. Too bad. This proposed SOC project aims to fix the issue.

References: 
 * Global Menu Specification - http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/wiki/GlobalMenuSpecification

=== Goals ===
Patch XUL runner to implement a Global Menu client inside it. 
 * Interpolate the menu into Global Menu XML
 * Bind the XML to the toplevel window
 * Receive and understands the Global Menu events

=== Requirements ===
 * Experience with Openoffice programming model
 * C++ experience
 * Knowledge in X11 or GDK

== Patch Java Swing library ==

=== Background ===
Java Swing programs are yet another catagory of Global Menu exceptions. Back in 2 years ago, the mac-menu patch was able to steal the Java Swing menu bar without stability. Without digging deep into Java Swing library's source code, a stable patch is impossible.
This proposed SOC project aims to study the Swing library, to patch the library, and to make the library global menu friendly.

References: 
 * Global Menu Specification - http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/wiki/GlobalMenuSpecification

=== Goals ===
Patch Java Swing Library to implement a Global Menu client inside it. 

=== Requirements ===
 * Familiarity with Java Swing library
 * Skills in Java programming language 
 * Perhaps also C/C++ depending on the language the swing library uses.
 * Knowledge in X11
