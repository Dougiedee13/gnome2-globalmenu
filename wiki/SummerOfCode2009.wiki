gnome-globalmenu: A GlobalMenu Applet for Gnome
http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu

==Firefox and/or OpenOffice and/or Java compatibility patch (or native rewrite of menus)==

Benefits: Would remove the latest big blocker for a truly useable GlobalMenu
Requirements: Some experience with VALA and GTK is needed. Would need a knowledge of the Firefox and/or OpenOffice toolkit and maybe dbus



Rainwoodman (...@....com) is willing to mentor this project.

==True default desktop menu==

==Windows port of GlobalMenu==
