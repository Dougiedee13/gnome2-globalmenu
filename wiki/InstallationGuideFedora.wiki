#How to install Global Menu Bar on Fedora 8?

= Installation Guide =
You can install by RPMs. Or else you can build from source. See BuildFromScratch
== Install Global Menu and Patched GTK By RPMs ==
Install Global Menu library and servers. They are located at
[http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/downloads/list?can=2&q=fedora-packages&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount fedora-packages]
  * Install `libgnomenu`
  * Install servers. You can choose one or several among
    * `gnome-globalmenu-applet`
    * `xfce-globalmenu-plugin`
    * `gtk-globalmenu-server`
Then you have a Global Menu Environment setted up.

However no current GTK application is build up on Global Menu. To add global menu to your legacy GTK application, `gtk2` is to be patched.
[http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/downloads/list?can=2&q=gtk2-aqd+rpm&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount gtk2-aqd(rpm)]
  * The patched `gtk2` is named as `gtk2-aqd`, after the person who introduced Global Menu to GTK.
  * There is compatibility issue for different `gtk2-aqd` versions and `libgnomenu` versions during the life time of 0.4 series.
  * Because of a fault of development, No one can really track when the compatibility breaks easily.
  * Take care: the easiest way is always to use the *latest* SVN snapshot for *BOTH*

After installation of RPMS, two post-inst work needs to be done:
  * edit your `~/.bach_profile`, add or modify to include `libgnomenu` in your `GTK_MODULES` envinroment variable.
{{{
   GTK_MODULES=`libgnomenu`;
   export GTK_MODULES ;
}}}
  * Choose one of the servers, and set it up.
    * for `gnome-globalmenu-applet`, you can simplely add the applet 'GNOME Global Menu Applet' to your toppanel.
    * for `xfce-globalmenu-plugin`, since it don't work yet, you can't use it.
    * for `gtk-globalmenu-server`, add it to your session autostarts.
  * You may also want to edit `~/.libgnomenu.conf` to include quirks. There were some examples.
  * then log in and log out.

If you don't want Global Menu anymore, you have several choices:
  * Deny any of the menu server to startup; applications will seamlessly go back to local menu bar mode.
  * Remove `libgnomenu`. The server you installed will be removed as a dependency.
  * Remove `gtk2-aqd` and install `gtk2`. If you use graphical package manager, don't quit before you install `gtk2`.

You can also do all of them.
