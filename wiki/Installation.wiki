= How to Install Global Menu to your GNOME Desktop =

Global Menu works out of box.

  # Install a pre-built binary package
    * Ubuntu: Install from our [InstallingonUbuntu PPA repository]
    * Fedora: Search for globalmenu in Add/Remove Applications. (Available soon)
    * Not so lucky? You can always [BuildFromSource make install]
  # Add `Global Menu Panel Applet` (or an equivalent name in you language) to the top panel
  # Right click on applet and choose `Enable Global Menu` (or an equivalent name in your language)

That's all. It's just that easy!
