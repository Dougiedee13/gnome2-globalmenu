= How to Install Global Menu to your GNOME Desktop =

Global Menu works out of box.

  # Install a pre-built binary package
    * Ubuntu: `deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/globalmenu-team/ubuntu intrepid main`
    * Fedora: [http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/downloads/list?can=2&q=rpm&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount Download the latest RPM]
    * Not lucky? You can always [BuildFromSource make install]
  # Add `Global Menu Panel Applet` (or an equivalent name in you language) to the top panel
  # Right click on applet and choose `Enable Global Menu` (or an equivalent name in your language)

That's all. It's just that easy!
