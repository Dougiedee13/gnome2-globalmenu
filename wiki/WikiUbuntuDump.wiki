Note : this GTK Global Menu hack won't work with XUL apps (e.g. Firefox), Java swing apps (e.g. OpenOffice) and all KDE apps or non-GTK apps.

----

= Installation instructions =

This page offers several different methods to install the patched Gtk:
 
 * New project
   * you can use [[#deb|deb packages]]. (debs of the new global menu project)
   * you can built yourself the [[#ng|new global menu]] from rainwoodman project

 * Old project
   * you can use the standard [[#autotools|autotools]] (configure/make/make install) method. (based on the old AdQ patch)
   * you can use the [[#apt-build|apt-build]] method (you will build debs). (based on the old AdQ patch)

You can as well build the applet from the source code
 * Instructions to [[#compile|compile]] the Gnome Global Menu Applet.

= Skinning instructions =
The default install doesn't handle well transparency or colors , and you may want it to look like more a famous OS, or just add a bit more transparency. Head to [[#skinning|skinning]] for detailed instructions.

= Uninstall instructions =
Should you wish to uninstall global-menu, head to the [[#uninstall|uninstall instructions]]

=== Info to build the latest Global Menu ===

=== Install using apt-build ===

Install the mac menu applet deb package (note: you must be a member of ubuntuforums.org to be able to download it: http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=47899&d=1193414016) , then in a terminal, type in this to install apt-build

Code: {{{
sudo apt-get install apt-build
}}}
Choose to add apt-build repository to your sources.list when asked.

After, I told apt-build to get libgtk2.0-0 source package (apt-build takes care of the build deps for you, ie: -dev packages)
You need to have the Ubuntu sources repositories enabled (menu System > Administration > Software sources, then pick Ubuntu software tab and check Source Code box).

Code: {{{
sudo apt-build source libgtk2.0-0
}}}
Next step was to copy the downloaded patch [[#two|2]] from where is was (on the desktop in _this_ case, replace "~/Desktop/" with the path where you downloaded the gzipped patch) to the libgtk2.0-0 source package directory
If you also want to remove the underlines use the patch 098_no_label_underline.patch [[#three|3]]

First, uncompress 099_mac_menubar.patch.gz :

Code: {{{
gzip -d ~/Desktop/099_mac_menubar.patch.gz
}}}
then copy the patches to the patches directory (assuming they are on your Desktop, if it's not the case replace ~/Desktop/ with the path were the patches are located)

Code: {{{
sudo cp ~/Desktop/099_mac_menubar.patch /var/cache/apt-build/build/gtk+2.0-2.12.0/debian/patches/
sudo cp ~/Desktop/098_no_label_underline.patch /var/cache/apt-build/build/gtk+2.0-2.12.0/debian/patches/
}}}
And, add the name of the patches you have added (i.e."099_mac_menubar.patch", "098_no_label_underline.patch")to the debian/patches/series list

Code: {{{
sudo gedit /var/cache/apt-build/build/gtk+2.0-2.12.0/debian/patches/series
}}}


Now we use use apt-build to build the packages

Code: {{{
sudo apt-build install libgtk2.0-0
}}}
'''NOTE''' Be Patient, this compiles from source, which will take considerably longer than installing from the Binary Package (Binary ~1 Minute | Source ~30 Minutes)<<BR>><<BR>>
After that you'll have an update for libgtk in your update manager (it won't install automatically because local apt-build repository isn't signed), let update manager install them and finally, add the applet to the top panel.
Now you need to log out/in gnome to see the changes.



= Uninstall instructions =
<<Anchor(uninstall)>>

==== For the apt-built method ====


If you have used the apt-build method to install the patched gtk do this to uninstall :
1. Go to menu system > administration > software sources. Pick the “third party software” tab, and uncheck apt-build repository.

2. Then in a terminal type in:
      
 Code: {{{
      sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --reinstall -y libgtk2.0-0 
      }}} 

3. Logout / in gnome to apply changes.


==== For all methods ====

Because Mac-Applet-Menu is hacked, the way to uninstall it has a trick.

Open Gedit and paste this : export GTK_MENUBAR_NO_MAC=1

Name the text file .gnomerc and save it in your home folder (/home//).
Logout ,relogin and the hack should be disabled.

If you want to completely remove it, fire up synaptic and search for libgtk2.0-0.
Highlight it and go to menu -> packages -> force version ,
select the version that ends with the stable release of the ubuntu version you're running (eg: edgy, feisty, gutsy) , press ok and then apply in synaptic.

== Further development ==

As it is now, the global menubar is only hack. To get it included into GTK+, quite some changes will be necessary. GTK+ developers have stated that they will not include the patch in it's current form.

A rewrite would probably also include patches made for Gtk+ for OSX from Imendio.

On the inability of KDE apps to use this menu, doesn't KDE already have support for a global menu bar?  Wouldn't it be feasible to make some sort of link between the KDE menus and this menu bar?
