== GlobalMenu Application for inclusion as a GNOME module ==

Dear list,

This is a proposal on behalf of the GlobalMenu developers for its inclusion either in gnome-applets or as a dependancy of GNOME.

GlobalMenu is an applet that lets the user have its application menus displayed in the Panel rather than in the Windows. For those who haven't heard about it, think of GNUStep or MacOS as an example. Or you can look at a screenshot to get an idea  http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu

 * Target: proposed for the desktop module set
 * Dependencies: No new dependencies are introduced for either compiling the released tarball or the runtime. An up-to-date vala compiler for the developers.
 * Resource usage: currently no NOME infrastructure are allocated for the project.  Google Code is the main hosting service and Launchpad is used for Ubuntu packaging and translations. If accepted the team would transport the project onto the GNOME infrastructure.
 * Adoption in Distributions: none so far.

 * GNOME-ness & community: The project uses vala as the main programming language. Various bugs in vala were discovered and fixed by the Global Menu developers. For the moment the team doesn't strongly need to cooperate with the internationalization, user documentation, accessibility, usability, bugsquad teams(and etc) of the community. The team is always open to such cooperation.

 * License : GlobalMenu is currently licensed under the GPLv2+ and LGPLv2+. The documentation and the majority of the code have all been written by team members; therefore the project can be easily re-licensed to meet the GNOME requirements.

 * Miscellaneous: 
    * Our pool of developpers with way too much time on their hands, committed doc writers, bug hunters and translators is an asset to keep deadlines, and to bring innovation, along with quality assurance. We have a good track record, as can be seen throughout our issue tracker and our Ubuntuforum thread. We strive to keep aware of all the evolutions going around, we successfully coordinated with KDE for the spread of the GlobalMenu spec beyond our initial GNOME focus.Willingness and ability to follow release rules and release schedule.
    * Progress on a regular basis: We have an Italian dev, but we also have a German dev and a Chinese dev. Overall, we have thus time-conscious people ;-)
    * Improving overall desktop usability: New applications should make the GNOME Desktop a more useful place to hack, work, and play in. That might include, for example, better feature parity with other desktops, cool new things other desktops don't have, feature upgrades from older GNOME versions, or better opportunities for integration with other GNOME applications. The goal is not to include every gtk2 application available, but to include the highest quality applications that will make us competitive and which offer a stable platform for improvement and integration going forward.
    * Developer attitude: We like to engage with upstream (GNOME for the moment :-) and downstream, as well as our user base. We're very open and our forum thread and our bug tracker testifies that. We engaged with GNOME, we engaged with XFCE and KDE. We're nice and cool people (really :-)
    * GNOME-ness: We use gtk2 and other GNOME2 technologies (VALA, all the standard GNOME guidelines and techniques) and we have a GNOME look and feel. We rewrote the software from ground to bottom to use the state of the art technologies.
    * Free-ness: We're using GPL v2 and later and LGPL2 and later (for some Vala files). We have an open developpement process and we prefer daily commits to large code drops.
    * Quality: We fix reported bugs at a very quick pace due to our various devs and motivation. We have no known showstopper. We're using Google Code for bug tracking, but we're perfectly fine with moving to Bugzilla should we be included.
    * UI: We have no problem engaging with the UI team to make GlobalMenu even better UI-wise.We strive to keep in line with the GNOME look and feel, HIG compliance,a careful choice of default settings, and clean interface design.
    * Accessibility: Though we haven't delved into the matter, we're also ready to engage should issues arise.
    * Internationalization is already done in the Gnome compliant fashion. All text is i18n-ized and the app is localized (RTL).
    * Use of GNOME resources: While we don't currently use them, we'll be happy to switch should our inclusion be accepted
   * Documentation: We already have some existing documentationin our wiki, and our code is clear and clean. We're willing whether to help the existing docs team, let them do as they please or join them. It's really up to them, but we're motivated to make great documentation available, even if we strive to make GlobalMenu as simple as it can possibly be while increasing its power. We'll contact soon the GNOME Documentation Team to organize about the matter.

Thanks a lot for bearing with that long and overly detailed proposal. I look forward to your reviews, comments, suggestions, bashings, etc :-)

Pierre

 1. Read the task-oriented requirements of GNOME Module maintainers.
   2. Read MaintainersCorner so you know about the day-to-day tasks of a GNOME maintainer.
   3. Have the maintainer (non-maintainer proposals are invalid) send an email to the desktop-devel mailing list. 

4.Build testing: Make sure the module is added to the proposed modules list in the jhbuild moduleset. Ping the GARNOME mailing list to include it too.
   5.Record the proposal: Maintainers of proposed modules should make sure their modules are listed in the relevant wiki pages (for example, 2.23 desktop suite page: http://live.gnome.org/TwoPointTwentythree/Desktop) with all the details (module name, link to svn, branch to use in svn, maintainers names, etc.) 
        o We don't need any new dependancies., we just need an up-to-date version of New dependencies for features should be added as soon as possible. There are three possibilities for dependencies: make them optional, bless them as external or include them in one of our suites. New dependencies should be known before feature freezes. A dependency can be proposed for inclusion AFTER the 2.23.1 release because it might need more time to be ready. 
    * How to propose an external dependency?
          o If you want to add a new dependency, make a good case for it on desktop-devel-list (this may only require a few sentences). In particular, explain any impact (compile and run time) on other modules
