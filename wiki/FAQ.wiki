 * Is it possible for global menu to support Firefox and Openoffice?
 * Why is the latest version missing functionalities ?
   * In order to get accepted in GNOME and for long term stability, we've decided to rewrite Global Menu in Vala. Starting from scratch allowed us to have an overall better design, and for the code to be more simple for new developers.
   * The drawback is that we have to reimplement all the features of the previous version. If you think you can help, just chime in !
   * And no: for the moment we don't plan to reinclude the hacks that allowed OpenOffice and some others programs to be natively compatible. If you find a clean solution we'll be all very happy to merge it in the project though.

 * I would like the Global Menu to have feature X, Y and Z. What can I do to tell the developers ?
   * You can look in *Issues* to see if the feature you want has been already asked for. If so, just star it (and comment it only if you need to).
   * Otherwise, just report it in *Issues* in a clear and professional way.
