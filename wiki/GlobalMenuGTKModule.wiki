= Introduction =

libglobalmenu-gnome is a GTK plugin module that dynamically patches GTK to make it Global Menu compatible. It overrides several virtual functions, and register several signal handlers and emission hooks in a GTK-opaque way to achieve the following goals:
  * Serializing the GTK menu hierarchy to the XML reprensentation of Global Menu and set to the Menu Context.
  * Notifying the application about the arrival of any Menu Event

In short, it makes the idea of Global Menu possible in this complicated real world.
