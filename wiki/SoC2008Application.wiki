# A new GTK+ menu system providing a set of new GObject objects and GTK widgets, in parallel with the old system(GtkMenuBar, GtkMenuItem).

There is a fancy version of this document at 
http://code.google.com/p/gnome2-globalmenu/wiki/SoC2008Application

= Synosis =

The new menu system is a Global Menu System. Literally speaking, a Global Menu System is a menu system where main menu bar of every document window in a particular session/screen is centrally controlled by GLOBAL daemons. 

In this system, every document window can be associated with one main menu bar, which provides an access to the application operations, either targeting at the document or the application itself.

In the future, the application-targeting operations shall be provided in an application menu bar, and always combined with current document's main menu bar.

As a contrast, in the old GTK+ menu system, the menu bar is associated with an application window. The best example is from GIMP. The toolbox window has a menu bar, which is a collection of appication operations, and is (almost) duplicated in every document window.

A screenshot is the best demonstration for a Global Menu.

There will be three major products for this SoC Project.
  * A DBUS based Global Menu System For GNOME
  * An X11 based Global Menu System. Still be useful if we hesitate from the DBUS dependency in GTK+. 
  * A handy small X11 based Object/Method/Signal IPC Framework.

Integration with GTK+ is also a major consideration all through the project.

= Benefits to GNOME =

 * It is a first attempt on decoupling core GTK+ components via IPC. The IPC idea might help us to build a smaller GTK+ that does more.
 * Helping the desktop environment to evolute from an application centric one toward a document centric one;
 * Similiar framework makes it easier to incorporate the native OSX menu system;
 * The same idea can be easily ported into the tool-bar system in the future.
 * The practical usefulness is still in controversial. 
   * A pool shows people are interested in a global menu system.

   * Some opposite opinions, several are very frightening.
