#How to install Global Menu Bar on Fedora 8?

= Ideas =

== patch gtk2 ==
the patch's name is gtk2-aqd the origin position is on aur linux's website and also can be find at ubuntu's forum. Patching gtk2 is necessary. The patch is more like a hack, so it is still faraway form entering the gtk2 official release.

== install a menubar server ==
there was a gtk-macmenu-applet for gnome-panel.
The newly completely rewritten version has been renamed into gnome2-globalmenu-applet

= Installation Guide =
Here I list two ways to install global menu bar
== By RPM ==

http://gnome2-globalmenu.googlecode...-3.fc8.i386.rpm
the gtk2-aqd rpm will obsolete gtk2 and provide gtk2, so the dependency tree will happy.
There is no way to have gtk2 and gtk2-aqd parallel installed.

http://gnome2-globalmenu.googlecode...-1.fc8.i386.rpm
after the rpms, right click on your top panel, choose add to panel, and select Global Menu
all the new gtk programs menubar will display in the top panel, with the mnemonic keys working.

== svn ==
Code:

svn checkout http://gnome2-globalmenu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gnome2-globalmenu-read-only


then there will be 3 directories under gnome2-globalmenu-read-only:
  * gtk2-aqd
  * gnome2-globalmenu-applet
  * gnome2-globalmenu-test
and one file
  * runtest.sh

=== gtk2-aqd ===
Suppose you have setup the rpm devel tree by `rpmdev-setuptree`.
{{{
env RPMDEVROOT={Your rpmdev tree root} make setup
env RPMDEVROOT={Your rpmdev tree root} make patch
}}}

Then build the rpm package

{{{
rpmbulid -ba gtk2-aqd.spec
}}}

The package should be located at `RPMS/i386`.

Alternatively, it is possible not to install but only have some of the application use the globalmenu bar by prefixing
{{{
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH={your gtk2-aqd directory}/libs
}}}
to your program. See `runtest.sh` for example.

=== gnome2-globalmenu-applet ===

{{{
configure; make
}}}
The executable is
{{{
src/gnome2-globalmenu-applet
}}}
Then a new standalone application is launched, it acts as a menubar server and collects clients' menubars.

It also can be placed into a panel. all you need is a bonobo .server file at correct location. Usually it requires root prilege to do this :(

Edit GNOME_GlobalMenuApplet.server.sample, APP_LOCATION with correct value and copy it(remove the .sample postfix) to `/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/`

Alternative way-generate a rpm:

{{{
make dist
cp *.tar.gz
{Yor rpmdev tree root}/SOURCES rpmbuild -ba gnome2-globalmenu-applet.spec
}}}



== Uninstall ==
If you find the global menubar boring/crashing your box/being criticized as plagiarizing OSX's interface and want to remove it.
  * Goto Add/Remove Software,
  * Search `gtk2`
  * Uncheck `gtk2-aqd`
  * Check `gtk2`
  * Press Apply
wait for `yum` to solve the dependencies. It should report no dependency problems.

All done!
